# Barfly
A mobile application for Android and iOS that allows users and businesses to post or report what restaurants/tap houses/breweries have on tap. Barfly allows beer enthusiasts to be up-to-date on the latest releases from their favorite breweries or pubs and provides notifications of upcoming events or specials. Barfly is business friendly and cultivates a social-media centric marketing environment with immediate access to interested customers. Barfly businesses are able to view and respond to user reviews and see what taps Barfly users are posting about most in regards to their tap list.
